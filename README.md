# ProxiGo

ProxiGo is a command-line tool written in Golang that helps you gather proxies from websites and save them into a text file.

## Installation

```

```

## Usage

To use ProxiGo all you have to do is run the executable once it is built or just use command go run to run the go file and enter type of proxies and name of proxy file where result will be stored and basically that is all it takes to get some fresh and mostly working FREE proxies that you can use for any purpose!

## Note

Keep in mind that this project is free and will remain free and open source to everyone wheather it be for learning something out of this project or to use it, so the quality of proxies is not the best but in my openion best to find and easiest to gather and is kept up to date in real time
